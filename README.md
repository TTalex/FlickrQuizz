##Introduction
FlickrQuizz is a web-based game using Flickr and Google APIs where the player has to guess locations of random pictures within a city.

An initial configuration allows the player to:
* Select the city he wants to play within
* Use a specific seed if he wants to challenge his friends on the same set of pictures
* Select a preferred game mode, endless continues until the player makes too many errors in a row, the other modes limit the number of pictures
